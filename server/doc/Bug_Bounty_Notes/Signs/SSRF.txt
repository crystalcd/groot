REPORT: https://hackerone.com/reports/997926

TITLE: SSRF - Unchecked Snippet IDs for distributed files

PROGRAM: Open-Xchange

TARGET APP: https://github.com/open-xchange/appsuite-middleware

APP FUNCTION: Messaging, collaboration, and office productivity software
    Dovecot - A IMAP, POP3 and Submission server for email.
    App Suite - Web-based access email, calendaring, cloud storage and office document editing.
    PowerDNS - A DNS server that enables domain resolution and network security features.

ENDPOINT: /ajax/snippet?action=new

CRUD / EXPLOITED FUNCTION: Create / Mail Service

SUMMARY: By using static code analysis, the researcher was able to force the app to poison a url that is later used by the server to make an internal request.  
This requred changing a boolean value from false to true, enabling additional functionality.  
Any user could perform this action on their own system, which allows that user to send the malformed url which would later be used to perform an SSRF attack.

TECHNICAL SKILL REQUIRED: Expert

TAKEAWAYS: 
1. Restrictions can be lifted by modifying code if the app has a local component (Android / Desktop App)
2. 
3. 

VULN DISCO AUTOMATION: None.  This exploit requires exploiting a specific Java class for this app that likely won't be used in other apps.
