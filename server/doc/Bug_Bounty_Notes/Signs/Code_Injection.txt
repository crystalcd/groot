TITLE: Code Injection via Insecure Yaml.load

PROGRAM: Kubernetes

APP FUNCTION: A collection of tools for testing automation in Kubernetes, a container orchestration system

ENDPOINT: https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra

CRUD / EXPLOITED FUNCTION: Create and Update / Test Scripts

SUMMARY: When parsing the test-infra repository, the researcher identified yaml.load() is used to update a configuration file, leading to code injection.  
This will only work (for the most part) if the tool is using PyYAML < 5.1

TECHNICAL SKILL REQUIRED: Moderate

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Code injection means the attacker can add their own code the application will later run.  Command injection is when the attacker gets the target server to execute comands remotely.
2. Check PyYAML for vulnerable version
3. 

VULN DISCO AUTOMATION:
1. Parse Github for YAML.load()
2. Scan for Python apps (Django/Flask)
3. Search Github for PyYAML in files with "requirements" in the name, then check manually
