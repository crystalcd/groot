TITLE: XSS - Notes - Attribute injection through overlapping tags

PROGRAM: Open-Xchange

APP FUNCTION: Application for taking personal notes.  Part of a larger app for workplace collaboration.

ENDPOINT: https://github.com/open-xchange/appsuite-middleware (Notes)

CRUD / EXPLOITED FUNCTION: Create / Image or File Upload (text converted to plain text file)

SUMMARY: The researcher noticed that the notes app performs several rounds of sanitizing/modifying input using the .replace method (Javascript).  
By adding a full URL in an <img src> tag, this will trigger a second .replace method that adds an <a href> tag into the <img src> tag.
Adding quotation marks will break the markup tag, adding an additional attribute (onerror for xss).  
This would normally break the image, but with a clever payload the researcher was able to fix the break, resulting in javascript being executed.

TECHNICAL SKILL REQUIRED: Expert

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Look for the .escape and .replace methods in javascript source code
2. Look for markup language in source code
3. Underscore is a common js library to escape special characters (& to &amp;)
4. Look for outdated versions of underscore.js (>=1.13.0-0 <1.13.0-2,>=1.3.2 <1.12.1)

VULN DISCO AUTOMATION: 
1. Wappalyzer to identify underscore.js version number

TITLE: XSS - Search - Unescaped contact job

PROGRAM: Open-xchange

APP FUNCTION: Acts as an address book.  Can add contacts, etc.

ENDPOINT: https://github.com/open-xchange/appsuite-middleware

CRUD / EXPLOITED FUNCTION: Create / Create Object

SUMMARY: Researcher noticed input text isn't sanitized when adding the Company or Position.  
This causes any user who searches for the attacker to have Javascript code execute on their device.

TECHNICAL SKILL REQUIRED: Novice

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Basic functions like sanitizing code can be overlooked by developers.
2. XSS payloads are not always executed on the page loaded after input.
3. Always use xxshunter for payloads (or set up a server to intercept requests)

VULN DISCO AUTOMATION:
1.
